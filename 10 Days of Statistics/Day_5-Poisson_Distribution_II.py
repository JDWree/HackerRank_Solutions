# Task
# The manager of a industrial plant is planning to buy a machine
# of either type 'A' or type 'B' . For each dayâ€™s operation:

# The number of repairs, 'X', that machine 'A' needs is a Poisson random variable
# with mean 'mA'. The daily cost of operating 'A' is 'CA = 160 + 40*X**2'.
# The number of repairs, 'Y', that machine 'B' needs is a Poisson random variable
# with mean 'mB'. The daily cost of operating 'B' is 'CB = 128 + 40*Y**2'.

# Assume that the repairs take a negligible amount of time
# and the machines are maintained nightly to ensure that they operate like new
# at the start of each day.
# Find and print the expected daily cost for each machine.
